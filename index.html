        Separated from their mother during Kobe's strategic bombing in World War II, 14-year-old Seita and his 4-year-old sister Setsuko wander in the carcass of the scorched city, scavenging for food. However, with their father serving in the Japanese Imperial Navy and their distant aunt only concerned about her family's survival, the siblings have no choice but to fend for themselves. After all, shelter and resources are scarce throughout the battle-scarred country. But life must go on. Why do fireflies have to die so soon?
